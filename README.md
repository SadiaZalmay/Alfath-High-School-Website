# Alfath High School Website
This is a full-stack web application developed for Alfath High School, the first public school in Afghanistan to have an official website, launched in 2019. The project was designed to provide a comprehensive digital platform for the school, featuring dynamic content and a user-friendly interface.
The website is built using a tech stack similar to my previous project, MaihanCarpet, and includes:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript
Backend: PHP
Database: MySQL
